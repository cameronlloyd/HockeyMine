Webscraping:
*  Team schedule scraping script got deleted :(
*  Features attained:
	  From Schedule: {GP, Date, Loc, Opp, GF, GA, Outcome, Wins, Losses, 
				OL, Streak, ROW, ShotsFor, ShotsAgainst, PIM, 
				PPG, PPO, SHG, PKM, PKG, PKO, L10Wins, L10Losses, 
				L10OL, TotWinPer, HomeWinPer, AwayWinPer}

	  From Matchups: {Corsi-for % (close), Corsi-for % (5v5), Corsi-for % (Even), 
				Save %, Avg Goalie count, Avg shift count, ATOI, GID} 

	  From Homepage: {Average Age, PDO, Face-off win %}

Preprocessing (Initially 1230 records, with 69 variables):
* Part 1:
* 	Remove date and team names
* 	Remove any record where either team has played less than 10 games (-141 records)
* Part 2:
*	Remove Outliers (-180 records)


Exploration 
* Part 1:
* 	Calculate differences between each attribute
* 	Find summary statistics of each attribute
*	Plot boxplots of each attribute
* Part 2:
*	Plot boxplots of each attribute

Model Building:




I would then build either all or a few of the following models:
	- Regression
	- Bayes
	- SVM
	- Random Forest
	- K-NN
