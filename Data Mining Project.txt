First I will split the 2015-2016 NHL season into two halfs to reduce the amount of data to scrape (since there are 82 games in a regular season) and keep the second half.
Then I will split the remaining data into something similar to a 66/33 training to testing split, where the training data would be strictly the dates before the data used in the testing data.
For each game, I will create one record containing the following data:
	* NOTE: The statistical data used for each record is from all the games within the 2015-2016 season leading up to the current event

	Home Team Name/ID (T1)
	Away Team Name/ID (T2)
	For both T1 and T2 on ALL games so far this season:
		5v5 Goals for/against 
		Takeaway/Giveaway Diff.
					
This would mean each record would contain roughly 38 attributes.  Since this is so high dimensional, I will likely exclude a few attributes that have been proven to be less useful in previous projects.

Then I would perform an exploratory analysis of the attributes

I would then build either all or a few of the following models:
	- Regression
	- Bayes
	- SVM
	- Random Forest
	- K-NN		



So this would be fairly similar to the extra credit assignment (with the exception of creating my own data set) if this is allowed
