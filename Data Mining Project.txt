Webscraping:
*  Team schedule scraping script got deleted :(
*  Features attained:
	  From Schedule: {GP, Date, Loc, Opp, GF, GA, Outcome, Wins, Losses, 
				OL, Streak, ROW, ShotsFor, ShotsAgainst, PIM, 
				PPG, PPO, SHG, PKM, PKG, PKO, L10Wins, L10Losses, 
				L10OL, TotWinPer, HomeWinPer, AwayWinPer}

Preprocessing (Initially 1230 records, with 69 variables):
* Part 1:
* 	Remove date and team names
* 	Remove any record where either team has played less than 10 games (-141 records)
* Part 2:
*	Remove Outliers (-180 records)


Exploration 
* Part 1:
* 	Calculate differences between each attribute
* 	Find summary statistics of each attribute
*	Plot boxplots of each attribute
* Part 2:
*	Plot boxplots of each attribute

Model Building:
* 66/33 training test split (559 and 310 respectively)
* 7 folds Cross-Validation on training set
* 
* Decision Tree:
*	Results:
*		TPR: 0.871262
* Random Forest:
* 	nTrees: 100
*       Tries bag sizes (p): {5,10,15,20,27}
*	Results:	
*		best p: 15
*		TPR: 0.953563
* Boosting:
*	lambda: 0.01
*	Bag Fraction: 0.5
*	Interaction Depths: {1,2,4,6}
*	noTrees: {300,500,700,900}
*	Results:
*		best ID: 1
*		best noTree: 300
*		TPR: 1.00
* Logistic Regression:
*	Results:
*		TPR: 0.8961537

0.9092347 0.9436228 0.9535630 0.9514312 0.9400531

I would then build either all or a few of the following models:
	- Regression
	- Bayes
	- SVM
	- Random Forest
	- K-NN
